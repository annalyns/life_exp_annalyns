# Abstract

Here, I re-examine the analysis of Oeppen and Vaupel (2002). The following code finds the highest life expectancy based on the sample data in gapminder_unfiltered.

# Life Expectancy Analysis
```{r 5.5.1 Exercise}
library(tidyverse)
install.packages("gapminder")
data("gapminder_unfiltered")

gapminder_unfiltered %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  filter(lifeExp == max(lifeExp)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  select(year, country, lifeExp) ->
  sumdat
```
